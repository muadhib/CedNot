# Welcome to my GitHub Site

Hi, my name is Cedric. I'm developper since many years and now I'm Lead developper in a four persons Team. I'm French and I live near Lyon.  
I'm passionate about developpement and more particulary in POO language and Optimization.

## My history
I discovered computering when I was 5 years with an Amstrad CPC 464. My mother have some books about development, so I started code with copying lines of code without understand anything. :)  
It was not surprising my parents when I told them I wanted to study computering.  
I'm quickly found work when I ended school. First, I create a software for manage Restaurant in Delphy. After, I join my actual company as hotliner / developper (Java). After two years I joined my actually team as developper (C# ASP.NET / JS / HTML5 / CSS) for create an invoices match engine and a book entry generator call GEC. We were the first team to work in Agility in the company.  
Actually, I'm always in the same team but now as team leader.  
Since I'm team leader, I have made somes changes : 
* Establish SCRUM Method (First, I as Scrum Master and now an other team member as Scrum Master)
* Create an Automated testing environnement (Protractor)
* Increase Quality Developpement (Code Review / Pair Programming / Sonar in Continuity integration)
* Focus the team level up ! 

## My capabilities
* C#
* SQL Server
* JavaScript
* SCRUM
* HTML5 / CSS3
